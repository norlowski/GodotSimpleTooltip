# GodotSimpleTooltip
A simple dynamic tooltip for godot

This is a simple project showing a basic method of adding tooltips on control elements. 
There are lots of possible improvements, but this method has really helped me iterate quickly on UI design. 
I wanted to be able to experiment with many different UI layouts/button types/tooltip content and wanted to be able to do it all from code.

I'll probably end up settling on something where most tooltips are text, but some will be entire scenes so that I can put images/textures in them.




I'm developing this tooltip along with Woodland Empire, an anti-citybuilder forest-growing game.
